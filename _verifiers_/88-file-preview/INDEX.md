# `88-file-preview`

Instance of this project's `_verifiers_`. **The claim it decides:** a file is previewed in exactly **one** place —
the File panel a click on the left panel opens — and each file type is rendered with the library appropriate to it.

This part replaced `89-markdown-view`, which judged a **Docs** tab that the owner removed. Its subject no longer
exists, so its claims moved here: what remains to judge is where a document is shown, and by what.

## Where it runs

**Headless browser.** The checks that need a page open a real Chrome with no window, through
[`_tools_/browser-use/`](../../_tools_/browser-use/INDEX.md); the rest drive the CLI and local HTTP
doubles. Nothing here needs a display, so it runs unattended.

## Running it

```bash
sh verify.sh            # every check, with the verdict
sh verify.sh --list     # the check names, and why any was unjudged
sh verify.sh --json     # one parseable object
```

Exit `0` when the claim holds, `1` when it fails, `3` when it could not be judged — a host without a browser is the
`3` case.

## PNG regression

The standalone PNG check in [`check.mjs`](check.mjs) drives offline HTTP and a headless browser against
both builds (default TypeScript CLI, or `HEDDLE_BIN` for Rust). It asserts actual image decoding,
accessible alt and decode-error text, `no-referrer`, and unchanged token/workspace refusals for the
metadata and raw-byte routes. This is PNG-only coverage, not an all-format or zoom claim.

```bash
_tools_/local-build/run --ts -- node --test --test-name-pattern='standalone PNG' _verifiers_/88-file-preview/check.mjs
```

Run from the repository root; build the selected CLI through its corresponding resource gate first.
